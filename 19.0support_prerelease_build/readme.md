# Switch Firmware 19.0 / Atmosphere 1.8 Pre-release update: 

Update #2: Oct 16th, 2024: 
The official Atmosphere repository has been updated with a Pre-release of ``Atmosphere 1.8`` that is compatible with ``Switch Firmware 19.0`` - 
* The files in the XGC Repository [here](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/Atmosphere_XGC_unstable_19.0release/tree/Xieon-patch-1/19.0support_prerelease_build) for ``Atmosphere_prerelease`` and ``Fusee.bin`` are the latest pre-release version copied from the official Atmosphere Repo - You can find the official pre-release these files were copied from [Atmosphere Releases](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases)
* * I currently do not know if this latest update breaks compatability with the programs such as ``Sysbot``, ``PkHex``, ``LiveHex``, & ``terafinder`` - 
* * * When I get a chance to update them on my own systems and test them I will update with the compatability status - 

The 1:1 Archive version of Atmosphere hosted in XGC's Org Github Repo's located [here](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/Atmosphere_XGC_unstable_19.0release/releases) will be updated after merging this branch, and commits into the unstable version with a pre-release containing the compiled pre-release files that are located in this no longer 1:1 archve repo - 


Updated the pre-release with the following information: 

Update: October 16th, 2024: Atmosphere 1.8.0 pre-release 
This is no longer a true archival version - since there have been edits made by me that are not instantly able to merge with the latest upstream commits from the official Atmosphere - 
* I've renamed this repository - to ``unstable_19.0release``  
* The latest switch firmware is ``19.0`` - The pre-release/soon to be released latest version of Atmosphere is ``1.8.0``
* * The current main atmosphere repository hasn't had the official release updated with new compiled files - 
* * If it gets updated with the newest files - or if I get a chance to compile it myself I will update this with the new files.

There's a pre-release hosted on XGC located [here](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/Atmosphere_XGC_unstable_19.0release/releases)
* This has compiled files that are compatible with the Switch Firmware ``19.0`` update - and is the pre-release of the official atmosphere ``1.8.0`` release. 
* * These files will allow you to boot into CFW on the Switch - 
* * Warning: The current pre-release files breaks compatability with many programs that XGC uses, and has forks, or acrhive copies hosted on the XGC Org Github - including ``Sysbot``, ``PkHex``, ``LiveHex``, & ``terafinder`` for example. 
* * * It is recommended that you STAY on version ``18.1`` or ``18`` of the Switch's Firmware until there is an official release. If you are using any of the above listed programs they currently will not work with ``19.0`` - 
* * * If you accidentally updated to ``19.0`` your choices are waiting - or you can use the files in the pre-release to boot into CFW then rollback the Switch's firmware to ``18.1`` while waiting for the compiled Atmosphere ``1.8`` release to be made available. Depending on the duration of time that takes, I will make the files and instructions needed to rollback firmware available within [this repository](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/Atmosphere_XGC_unstable_19.0release)
