# Switch Firmware 19.0 / Atmosphere 1.8 Pre-release update: 

Updated the pre-release with the following information: 

Update: October 16th, 2024: Atmosphere 1.8.0 pre-release 
This is no longer a true archival version - since there have been edits made by me that are not instantly able to merge with the latest upstream commits from the official Atmosphere - 
* I've renamed this repository - to ``unstable_19.0release``  
* The latest switch firmware is ``19.0`` - The pre-release/soon to be released latest version of Atmosphere is ``1.8.0``
* * The current main atmosphere repository hasn't had the official release updated with new compiled files - 
* * If it gets updated with the newest files - or if I get a chance to compile it myself I will update this with the new files.

There's a pre-release hosted on XGC located [here](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/Atmosphere_XGC_unstable_19.0release/releases)
* This has compiled files that are compatible with the Switch Firmware ``19.0`` update - and is the pre-release of the official atmosphere ``1.8.0`` release. 
* * These files will allow you to boot into CFW on the Switch - 
* * Warning: The current pre-release files breaks compatability with many programs that XGC uses, and has forks, or acrhive copies hosted on the XGC Org Github - including ``Sysbot``, ``PkHex``, ``LiveHex``, & ``terafinder`` for example. 
* * * It is recommended that you STAY on version ``18.1`` or ``18`` of the Switch's Firmware until there is an official release. If you are using any of the above listed programs they currently will not work with ``19.0`` - 
* * * If you accidentally updated to ``19.0`` your choices are waiting - or you can use the files in the pre-release to boot into CFW then rollback the Switch's firmware to ``18.1`` while waiting for the compiled Atmosphere ``1.8`` release to be made available. Depending on the duration of time that takes, I will make the files and instructions needed to rollback firmware available within [this repository](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/Atmosphere_XGC_unstable_19.0release)
