# Switch Firmware 19.0 / Atmosphere 1.8 Pre-release update: 

Updated the pre-release with the following information: 

Update: October 16th, 2024: Atmosphere 1.8.0 pre-release 
This is no longer a true archival version - since there have been edits made by me that are not instantly able to merge with the latest upstream commits from the official Atmosphere - 
* I've renamed this repository - to ``unstable_19.0release``  
* The latest switch firmware is ``19.0`` - The pre-release/soon to be released latest version of Atmosphere is ``1.8.0``
* * The current main atmosphere repository hasn't had the official release updated with new compiled files - 
* * If it gets updated with the newest files - or if I get a chance to compile it myself I will update this with the new files.
